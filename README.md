# HAPPY BIRTHDAY ‚úåÔ∏è!!!!

Kayla and I have prepared for you a kit to build a cool piece of artwork. Now you can solder and hammer your way to your own unique form of artistic expression! Let's make some art so cool that one older art teacher you had would have his brain wrinkled at the thought!

So the general idea for this is:

- LEDs go in the box
- LEDs connect to the arduino
- String art goes on top of it

We've got some sample code here that will get you off your feet, and some pics with vague suggestions on where to place the LEDs. 

## The LEDs!

You'll need to solder the strips and connect them to your Arduino. That's right, we didn't do _shit_ for you. You can earn your own damned birthday present. This picture shows you what you already probably know, but just look at how good that soldering job is, eh? Try and be at least a tenth as good as that üòè.

Next, use the adhesive to attach them however the hell you want in the box but make sure the wires are coming out the back through the hole YOUR DEAR, DEAR, SELFLESS FRIENDS SO GRACIOUSLY CUT FOR YOU. But we suggest attaching first, and programming later. That way ya get to see how it'd look in real time üòä

Maybe tape them in a circle around the box? Or whatever. Who cares, this is a github repo, not a cop.

## The ARDIUNIO!

We got you an Arduino Nano! We fucked up a bit cause we got you one that runs at 3.3V instead of 5V BUTTTT we tried it out and it still runs the LEDs just fine, so we are going to pretend like it was built for it :P. If you want to get some extra info on the board we got you go here: https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano

Ok...now let's SET IT UP! You'll need to first install the Arduino IDE by going here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#future-version-of-the-arduino-ide  

If you have a windows machine then you'll need to download the driver for the Nano cause we got that cheap shizz from China that used a different chip than our comps are used to recognizing. Here's where you can download it: https://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html 

Definitely looks sketch, mostly cause you wont be able to understand any of it, but we tried it out and it works great. We got the instructions from this instructable: https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Nano-USB-Not-Recognizing-Fix/ if you're still sketched out by it you can also program it at our place or just use the starter code that we already programmed on it! 

To get the code 

Wow, isn't it fucking fantastic that Kayla provided some sample code to play with! Well, here it is in NAMETHISFILELATER.WHATEVER.

...etc etc...

## The NAILS

Kayla literally told me just now "make sure you put in there that when she hammers the nails she has to make sure the nails don't move." So, when you nail them make sure they don't move. Got it? Great.

Here is a picture of one of the many ways Kayla experimented with this. Idk if she suggests this method but whatever

![nail the outside not the inside whoah who just said that](images/4.jpg)

Once it's nailed properly, tie it up!

## String it UP

There's a LOT of inspiration you can take for string art. Like, take a look at some of these fuckers:

https://youtu.be/sfXcEXDesHM

Or, you could just take the search term "string nail art circle" and search yourself. It's not rocket science. BUT, if you fuck this up and it looks bad we'll forever judge your for your ineptitude. 

## Put it somewhere

Now that's done, put it somewhere! If you're proud of it, put it somewhere others can see it! If you aren't pretend like you are forever working on your unfinished masterpiece and hide it somewhere in shame. Follow your own artistic process!

We hope you had as much fun making this as Kayla did. And, of course, as I did helping Kayla. Here's a picture of us having fun together but our faces are censored since this is a public git repo ü•∞
